# 🙌🏻 Hi people! 🙌🏻
I'm a Chilean **Front-end Developer** passionate about building *joyfull* and *pretty* interfaces to complement solutions to innovative problems.

## 💻 Tech Stack 💻

I work mainly with modern frameworks like **Vue 3**, **Flutter**, **Flask**, and **Node.js**.  
Being *innovative by nature*, I often use this space to experiment, test ideas, and stay sharp.

🔒 Most of my professional projects live in **private repositories** linked to company-specific profiles, but my passion for clean, maintainable, and scalable code is definitely well known.

## GitHub Stats
I'll leave my stats here with the hope that, in the future, they might reflect some of my private work — for now, they don’t make much sense 😣

## 🚀 Current Project
🔭 I'm currently working on a personal project called **Turin** with [Bastián Contreras](https://github.com/BFCW-Was) — an application designed to highlight *lesser-known tourist spots* in (for now) Chile.
> Turin aims to support **local tourism** by helping users discover hidden gems and build *personalized travel routes*. Coming soon!

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- If I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **exploring different kinds of cuisines** or playing something on **Steam** 😶‍🌫️
- I love asian cuisine 🍜
- I hope to launch ur app someday!
